This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Deploy on o2switch

Build the project from your dev environment.

```bash
  scp -r .next/ <user>@<ip>:/home/<user>/apps/<app>/
```

You can run the script deploy.sh with the good options to automate this process.
